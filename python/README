To run the program that calculates recurrence relations, follow these steps:
1. run the command 
	make compile file=recurrenceRelations.ml

	it will create an executable file 'test' and folders that are required for storing traces of analyzed functions

2. generate traces of functions by executing the command
	make gen-logs

3. run 'analyzer' over the generate traces (but before that make sure that analzyer has enough permissions to be executed)
	./analyzer double_rec_call/

	or

	./analyzer binary_search/

	Analyzer retrieves files with traces from a supplied folder and calculates coeficients.
	Then, it uses the given data to train the linear regression model and generate prediction results. 
	The results of the analyzer are printed out to stdout.
